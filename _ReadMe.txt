0 are the original codes
1 is the replication (I did some small changes here)
2 is the first change, where I removed rho and estimated a single s^*
3 is the second change, where I tried to get a regime switching model going 
4 is my first try on change point models 

*** to run the code you may have to create a results folder where the code is going to store things and read them later
